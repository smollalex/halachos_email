    <h1>Halacha No. 499</h1>
      <h2>Body Care</h2>
      <p>Rubbing ointment on a baby's body on Shabbos is not permitted.</p>
      <p>However, it is permitted to apply oil of a normal consistency (as opposed to thick oil) to a baby's body with one's bare hands, or with a piece of non-absorbent, synthetic fabric, like plastic.</p>
      <p>One may use an absorbent cloth, like cotton, only to wipe over the oil once it has been applied to the body.</p>
      <h2>Previous Halacha (Review)</h2>
      <p>If one's hands have been dirtied with mud or the like on Shabbos, one must not wipe them clean on a towel or with a handkerchief, which one might come to wash in order to remove the dirt. However, one may wipe one's hands on a cloth which one does not mind becoming dirty.</p>
